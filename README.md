## Flower Plants Power BI Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to present flower data—such as Flower Name, Common Name, Height, Color, Description, Plant Type, Water Needs, Sun Requirements, Blooming Season, Maintenance Level, and more—using a slicer to filter and display one flower at a time, complete with its image. It’s an invaluable tool for organizations involved in landscape architecture and horticulture, enabling them to analyze floral characteristics and behavior in depth.

####Tools Used:

- Excel – for data cleaning and preliminary analysis
- Power BI – for building interactive visualizations
- Figma – for designing the dashboard background

All project files—including the Power BI .pbix, Excel dataset, PNG images, etc.—are available for download on my GitHub:
